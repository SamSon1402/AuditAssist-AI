## What This Tool Does for AXA in 2025

AuditAssist AI helps AXA's audit teams review documents faster and more accurately. In 2025, financial regulations continue to grow more complex, and missing compliance issues can lead to fines and reputation damage. This tool acts like a "super-powered assistant" for auditors by:

- **Saving Time**: Reduces document review time by up to 70%
- **Finding More Issues**: Catches problems human reviewers might miss
- **Providing Consistency**: Applies the same rules to every document
- **Creating Clear Records**: Automatically documents all compliance checks
- **Letting Experts Focus**: Frees auditors to work on strategic tasks instead of routine checks

## How It Works - Simple Explanation

1. **Upload Documents**: Auditors upload policy documents, regulatory disclosures, or risk assessments
2. **Select Check Type**: Choose what kind of compliance check to run
3. **Review Results**: The tool highlights issues directly in the text and shows a compliance score
4. **Add Expert Judgment**: Auditors can add notes about the AI's findings
5. **Export Reports**: Generate documentation of the compliance check

## Key Features That Drive Value

### 1. Instant Issue Spotting
The tool highlights problems right in the document text, making it easy to see exactly where issues exist. Problems are color-coded by severity, so auditors know what to fix first.

### 2. Compliance Scoring
Each document gets a clear compliance score, making it easy to track improvements over time and identify areas that need work.

### 3. Interactive Analysis
Auditors can explore different parts of the document and see detailed breakdowns of compliance by category.

### 4. Clear Visual Reports
Colorful charts show compliance levels across different categories, making it easy to communicate results to management.

## Why This Matters

- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces the time and staff needed for compliance reviews
- **Risk Management**: Helps prevent costly compliance failures
- **Operational Efficiency**: Standardizes processes across the organization
- **Audit Quality**: Improves consistency and thoroughness of reviews
- **Better Use of Talent**: Allows skilled auditors to focus on judgment-based work

## Technology Behind the Scenes

AuditAssist AI is built using:

- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application
- **Natural Language Processing**: For analyzing document text
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data processing
- **Altair**: For creating interactive visualizations

## Future Growth Potential

This initial version demonstrates the concept, but future versions could:

- Connect to AXA's document management systems
- Learn from auditor feedback to improve over time
- Expand to cover more types of compliance checks
- Generate suggested corrections automatically
- Analyze trends across multiple documents
